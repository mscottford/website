  I'm Scott, a software engineer with a passion for improving and maintaining
  existing codebases. With over a decade of experience, I specialize in
  wrangling legacy systems to enhance scalability, stability, and
  sustainability. When I'm not coding, you'll find me sharing my knowledge in
  various formats, including the [Legacy Code Rocks](https://legacycode.rocks)
  community/podcast, conference talks, and on this site.
