I was banging my head against my keyboard trying to figure out at problem yesterday, right before I stopped for the day. I got up from my desk and within 15 minutes, I had “figured it out”. Trouble is, now I’ve forgotten that epiphany, and I’m right back where I started. Grr…

Update: I just remembered what my epiphany was. The interesting thing is it wouldn’t have solved my problem. I figured out the correct solution just a few moments ago. :)
