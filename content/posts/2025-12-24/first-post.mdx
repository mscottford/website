Some content before the first heading. Otherwise things render oddly.

## Sample MDX Post

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

```js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

This is a sample post to demonstrate MDX capabilities in the blog.
You can include **Markdown** syntax along with JSX components seamlessly.

Enjoy writing your posts with MDX!
