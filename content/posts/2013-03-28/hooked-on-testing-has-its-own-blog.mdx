I’ve started to [blog](http://hookedontesting.wordpress.com) much of the content that I’m writing my upcoming book, [Hooked on Testing](http://leanpub.com/hooked-on-testing).

My goal is to have about one post out a week. The content is not going to be released in any specific order, and it will likely be edited before inclusion in the book. It should give you a better glimpse into where I’m going, and you’ll be able leave comments and help shape the content before its written.

I’ve also created a new Twitter handle [@hookedontesting](https://twitter.com/hookedontesting) that I’m going to use to provide updates about the book, announce new blog posts, and interact with the larger community of developer-testers.

So feel free to follow along and participate in the creative process.
